# Full-Stack-Toy
---
## Overview

This project is meant to be a demonstration of an entire full stack app, from start to finish.
I will add to this project in many stages. Each stage will add additional complexity to this toy project, so that it will be clear how each part works.
Each stage will also have it's own branch in this repo. The main branch will be the latest iteration of the project. 

## Stages

Each stage will be on it's own separate branch, so that it is clear to see how an individual toy project works in isolation.

---
### __Main__  

This brach will be the latest iteration of the Toy Project. 

---
### __Introduction Branch__  

_Next_, _TS_, _REST API_, _MongoDB_, and _Hosting with Heroku_

This is going to simply be a basic library front end crafted with Next, MongoDB, hosted with Heroku, and the API will be RESTful.

---
### __Manual Hosting Branch__  

Next, TS, _GraphQL API_, _SQL DB_, _Hosting with Linode and NGINX reverse proxy_

This is going to be the basic library front end as in __Introduction branch__, but it will use GraphQL API, SQL DB, and be hosted with Linode manually. 

---
### __Docker and Load Balancing Branch__  

Next, TS, _Docker_, _2 GraphQL API_, _2 SQL DB_, Hosting with Linode and NGINX

Same as __Manual Hosting Branch__, but we add in a second SQL database and a second GraphQL API that will be containerized with Docker and Load Balanced with NGINX.

---
### __Microservices Branch__  

Next, TS, Docker, 2 GraphQL API, 2 SQL DB, Hosting with Linode and NGINX, and _Microservices_

Same as __Docker and Load Balancing Branch__, but we add in a _Microservice_ (Payment API).

---
### __Testing and CI/CD Branch__ 

Next, TS, Docker, 2 GraphQL API, 2 SQL DB, Hosting with Linode and NGINX, Microservices, _Testing_, _CI/CD_, _Deployment_

Same as __Testing and CI/CD Branch__, but we formally Test the Code using Unit, Integration, and Functional Testing methods. Next we introduce the Concept of Continuuos integration and Continuuous deployment to make our project more resilient. 

---
### __Flutter Branch__ 

Next, TS, Docker, 2 GraphQL API, 2 SQL DB, Hosting with Linode and NGINX, Microservices, Testing, CI/CD, Deployment, _Flutter_

Same as __Testing and CI/CD Branch__, but this time we add in a Flutter Mobile Front End UI. 

---
### __Tensor Flow Branch__

Next, TS, Docker, 2 GraphQL API, 2 SQL DB, Hosting with Linode and NGINX, Microservices, Testing, CI/CD, Deployment, Flutter, _TensorFlow_

Same as __Flutter Branch__, but this time we learn Tensor Flow and add in a basic ML model that can learn from the input data. 

---
### __Improving UI Branch__

Next, TS, Docker, 2 GraphQL API, 2 SQL DB, Hosting with Linode and NGINX, Microservices, Testing, CI/CD, Deployment, Flutter, TensorFlow

Same as __Improving UI Branch__, but we go back and we improve the UI in both the Next Front End and in the Flutter Front end. We use any libraries that may prove useful and develop more content on the front end to make the UI beautiful. 
We also will learn the basics of Adobe, Mock ups, and other software tools that will be used in Front End to quickly prototype mock ups.

## Domain of the Project

For this project, I will use the domain name: "example-store-front.xyz", as I already owned this domain and need a use for it.
